# Greed
The one game that feels like you know the game but it's not really the game but is actually the game that is another game of a game. Yes.

Greed is a game in which the player seeks to gather as many falling gems as possible. The game continues as long as the player wants more!

In actuallity this is a repurposed Robot Find Kitten code, a mod even. So go out there and try to catch gems instead of cats... or touch grass, that works too.

## Rules
---
Greed is played according to the following rules.

- Gems (*) and rocks (o) randomly appear and fall from the top of the screen.
- The player (#) can move left or right along the bottom of the screen.
- If the player touches a gem they earn a point.
- If the player touches a rock they lose a point.
- Gems and rocks are removed when the player touches them.
- The game continues until the player closes the window.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
